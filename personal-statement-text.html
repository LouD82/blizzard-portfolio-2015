				    <p>I was headed to the door on my last day at PointRoll when someone yelled, “Lou DiLello, everybody!” and the whole office clapped. I was flattered, of course, then promptly shot in the head with a Nerf dart. It was a cheap shot, really, as my own Nerf gun was packed away. We had the right creative atmosphere at PointRoll, and over the years I have learned that it takes more than individual skill to create a great product. It takes a great team. My attitude and approach as a team member have been shaped by personal experiences that are significant, but do not always belong in a cover letter or on a resume. I will discuss just a few of those experiences in this personal statement. I hope they add dimension to the person described in the rest of my application and illustrate my potential as a great teammate at Blizzard.</p>
				    <p>Some of my choices as an adult have seemed odd to friends and family, but all of them have led to formative and challenging experiences. For example, in 2005 I bought a 23’ sailboat with virtually no sailing experience. I wanted to know whether I could control something that big, and whether I could respond appropriately when sea or weather conditions changed. At first, the answer was an emphatic “no” on all counts. I hit almost every other boat in the marina trying to dock my first time. But I kept at it and before long I could take the boat out myself and dock it without issue.</p>
				    <p>Owning a boat also reinforced the value of hard work. A real sense of accomplishment came from jobs like scrubbing the teak, painting fresh bottom coats, replacing lines and servicing the motor. It was difficult and rewarding work, which I learned is my favorite kind. I also learned that whether a job is big or small, it is satisfying to do it well. While I no longer sail, what I found out about myself was well worth the time and expense (including all the tools I dropped in the water).</p>
				    <p>Later, I decided to pursue a master’s degree in philosophy, which made little sense in the context of my career. Almost immediately, though, I could tell that studying philosophy was paying dividends at work. It gave me a fresh perspective on challenging issues, both design-related and technical. Working with language and argument also made me a better communicator, a skill that I now use every day. I was even offered a graduate assistantship during my second year, one of only two made available to philosophy students. It was a long road, but I received my degree in December of 2010 after four years of night classes while working full-time.</p>
				    <p>And through it all I have been a gamer. In college, my necromancer was on the Diablo II hardcore ladder, and later I was a guild leader in World of Warcraft. I watch professional StarCraft II matches every day. Having played, I recognize it as among the most difficult sports in the world. My fiance (who is not an avid gamer) has recently been watching and enjoying it with me. There is even a line in our budget labelled “gomtv subscription.” I have also been following the development of Diablo III since that beautiful guitar chord was played at the 2008 Worldwide Invitational. But my favorite thing about gaming is that it brings my friends together. We drink beer, laugh, stay up late and slay demons. Does it get any better than that?</p>
				    <p>Along with my professional background, these personal experiences are the reason I see myself as a fun and productive member of the Blizzard team.</p>
